Final Project for Junior Design
This is my final design project for Electrical and Computer Engineering Junior Design at the University of Pittsburgh
DoodleBob is a personal drawing program that can be implemented on a Raspberry Pi.
DoodleBob_v2 is the working version of the DoodleBob code
DoodleBob.ui is the PyQt file for the menu UI
Those are the two relevant files for this project
